# `travl`

An AVL Tree crate with high customizability.

## About the name

It comes from a portmanteau of "tree" and "AVL", giving "travl", which can be read as "travel".

# Progress

- [ ] Basic AVL tree and operations
- [ ] Custom property accessor and ordering for trees
- [ ] Tree traversal visitor traits and iterators
- [ ] Multidimensional AVL trees (sets of AVL trees with special operations)
- [ ] Set operations between trees
- [ ] Complete the `serde_impl` module for `serde` feature support
- [ ] Criterion tests
- [ ] Optimize structures and operations using [`flamegraph`](https://lib.rs/crates/flamegraph)
- [ ] Implement allocation optimizations like those for [`BTreeMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html)
- [ ] Multidimensional AVL trees (support for simplex plots) (far future - may not be needed and therefore not implemented)
